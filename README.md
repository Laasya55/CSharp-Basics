# **C# Basics: Loops in Unity**  

This project demonstrates the basic usage of **for**, **while**, **do-while**, and **foreach** loops in C# through simple count-up programs. These examples are created in the context of Unity, providing a practical introduction to loops in game development.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Project Overview**  

The project contains scripts that illustrate how different types of loops work by counting from 1 to a specified number. Each loop type is showcased in a separate script to make it easy to understand and compare their functionality.  

---

## âœ¨ **Features**  

1. **For Loop**: Demonstrates a loop with a predefined number of iterations.  
2. **While Loop**: Uses a condition to continue looping until the condition becomes false.  
3. **Do-While Loop**: Executes the loop body at least once before checking the condition.  
4. **Foreach Loop**: Iterates over a collection, such as an array or list.
